# Crypto Profit Calculator

# Project Overview

I created this calculator to make it easier for me to just enter in some data, and have an app tell me what my profit is so far.  All you do is:

1. Enter the number of coins you currently have
2. Figure out what the average cost per coin is by adding up all of the prices per coin at the time you bought the coin.  You will then divide that total by the number of purchases you made. 
3. Enter the current price of the coin.
4. You would then click on the "Calculate" button where the results would be shown right below the buttons.
5. You may then click on the "Reset" button to return things back to normal.
